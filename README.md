just to know how it works 

Hello people,

I'm Haruko, 3rd year PhD student in UoL.
I like math, especcially probability theory. I also like coding.
But I'm always not confienct enouch to say it since I feel like I don't have enough skills to say it.
I'm a foody, I love eating. I like outdoor activities such as hiking and cycling. I like running as well.
I also like indoor activities such as playing video game, reading books, playing board game, paiting etc.
